### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

Currently this app only converts dollar to iranian rial and vice versa. It can be later expanded to support more currency exchanges.

### Useful resources

- [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) - Used this API for fetching dynamic official currency exchange rates.
- For the free market currency exchange, a static currency exchange rate is used.
